Training of the mice to perform cue discrimination task involves a few different phases. and Each phase will use different arduino codes 
to archieve the training goal. 
1, train the mice to asscociate nose poke with milk delivery at a specific reward spout
2, train the mice to nose poke and get rewards at different spouts based on the sensory cues
3, train the mice to nose poke, make the correct action choices to activate the pump, and collect the reward

phase 1 involves arduino code: (1) lick_detection_left_right (2) final_interleaved_sound_discrimination_poke_induced_milk
phase 2 involves arduino code: (1) lick_detection_left_right (2) final_interleaved_sound_discrimination_poke_induced_milk
phase 3 involves arduino code: (1) lick_detection_left_right (2) final_interleaved_sound_discrimination_lick_onset
